# API Challenge

## Context

For this challenge, the goal is to create a REST API that can be used to retrieve user information by ID. The data for user information can be found in the file `data.json`.

- Use any libraries that you want to use.
- There's no "right" way of doing this.
- Lean on the interviewers for support if you get blocked - this is a pairing session and not a solo test.
- Share your thought process out loud as you go. This is the most interesting thing for the interviewers. :)

## Challenges

1. Create a REST API with an endpoint that can be used to retrieve the user's id, name, and email address by ID. You can decide on an URI structure - there is no wrong answer.
2. Change the display of the user's name to be surname first and capitalized, followed by a comma, a space, and then the first name. e.g "REES, Dayle"
3. Show the current count of points for each user in the API response.
